<div id="me">

	<p style="font-family: Arial Black, Gadget, sans-serif;">I am a relatively new self taught software developer.  My point of focus is web services like this one to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable while doing the things they already do.  In the software community it's widely accepted that we are a means of life quality embetterment.  With life's pace on the rise, the means by which we as humans get what we need, or think we need, must become equally quickly paced and readily accessible.  As one of the more renowned John Peters puts it, complex but not complicated.  We must strive to make our designs as complex as necessary, without skipping important details, yet presenting these complexities in a way that can be widely used, and widely accepted as an advancement.  With software we as individuals are enabled to have a directly contributing hand in the innovations that make our world advance as a whole.  We each have a part in the globally connected world we now now and love.  Connectivity is key in this day in age, and we must stay connected to our fellow human's needs as softeware developers.  My goal is to have a life in software, developing, building, researching, and learning.  For when I found software, I found my career.</p>
